Hi Raj,

Thanks for reaching out! I am happy to help with your questions about the text files in the database.

1. Our database servers are hosted on Michigan Academic Computing Center (MACC) which is a large 2 MW data center located in Ann Arbor. The data center is equipped with backup power supplies, very reliable cooling systems (AC cooling aisles for example) and high-speed network connections. With the uninterrupted power supply (UPS) and the backup generators, the data center can be still running even in case of power outages. So don't worry about it. Our data will be safe. And the cooling systems are also very reliable. There are many cooling aisles, and the temperature is kept at a pretty constant level. The center is also equipped with well-designed fire suppression systems.
