Hi Jack,

Sorry for the work last week. I was not aware of the requirement that I need to push my edits to a separate branch. I redo it this week. Please see the attached screenshots for my work below :). 

I have made separate commits for each file. And push it to `TICKET103`.

I have also created a pull request on the repo.

Let me know if you have any additional questions.

Best,  
Jonas
