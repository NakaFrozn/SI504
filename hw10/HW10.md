Hi HR Team,

Thanks for reaching out. I have attached my responses to your requests below.

For maggie@borromean.digital,

1. The person has made 15 commits to the repo.

2. To inspect the details of commits that Maggie has made, I used `git log --author="maggie@borromean.digital --stat` to inspect the messages and the files each commit has changed.

3. Generally, I think Maggie's commit messages are clear. But personally I prefer the commit message to be a short imperative sentence without commas. Like, "fixed bug, now just a unique key warning" needs to be changed to "fixed bug on *(issue)*".

For Tony Soprano (Tony@borromean.digital), I used `git log --author="Tony@borromean.digital" --oneline` to list out all the commits. The first commit made by Tony is 6ef0971 and the latest one is 5458c1f.

6. The commits made by Tony (Tony@borromean.digital) were all from March to June in 2020. There were no commits in September. I double checked it. Do you want to check other's commits? Or Tony may use different usernames?

7. Between Dec 2 and Dec 5 in 2020, the commits were all created by Raj Kumar. I learned from the manual that I can only display the commit id, author and time using the `--pretty` option.

8. Line 70 in the settings file is edited by Kim in commit a1112335. I used `git blame src/officehours/settings.py`

I further used `git show a1112335` to see the edits in that commit. That commit edits /src/officehours_ui/templates/base.html
